# Numerical Approximation of Maxwell's Equations using IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA)

This repository contains the code implementations for my Master's thesis on the numerical approximation of Maxwell's equations using IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA). The primary focus of this work is to leverage the power of IGA for solving Maxwell's equations in complex geometries, with an emphasis on improving the efficiency and accuracy of numerical methods in electromagnetic field simulations.

## Key Features

- **Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)**: Implementation of IGA for the discretization and solution of Maxwell's equations.

- **Finite Element Methods**: Integration of IGA with traditional finite element methods for improved results in electromagnetics simulations.

## Requirements
- CAD 
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
